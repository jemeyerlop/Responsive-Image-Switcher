RIS allows to switch between four different sizes of the same image (or different images if you want to) depending on the width of the element that contains the image and the device pixel ratio.

It allows to configure for each image an own file path, format and set of sizes, by the use of HTML 'data' attributes. In addition, passing a numerical value to the function 'imageSwitcher()' allows to establish the minimal device pixel ratio that is expected for the load of a higher resolution image (if no argument is passed to the 'imageSwitcher()' function, the default minimal device pixel ratio value will be 2).
